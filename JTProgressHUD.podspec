                   **JTProgressHUD** is the new **HUD** designed to show **YOUR** views (eg. UIImageView animations) in the **HUD style** **with one line of code**. You can see many HUDs with easy implementation, but **the idea** is that you want that **easy implementation** with **HUD style** (background that block views below so the user knows that something is processing), but want to **show YOUR** animations/views (could be your appâ€™s animated logo). *By DEFAULT* one animation is also included/built-in.
